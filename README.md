Bass Boiz is a Bass fretboard memorization tool that dynamically renders a note on the fretboard for the user to guess. Once a user has typed in a note, they can hit the "submit" button to see if they were correct. If they were, their score will increment. If not it will reset to zero. I still need to write in the put request to post high scores to the leaderboard but this was a 48 hour project and hand placing all 84 notes using styled components took up a lot of the time I had to do it.

Have fun learning the fretboard!
